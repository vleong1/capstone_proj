    "- Based on the matching criteria, the user input is that of a **straight male** with an **age range between 35 - 48**, who **has kid(s) and wants more**, and is **Christian**. A user specifying their religion indicates that religion matters to them, so the recommendations return other users who are Christian / serious about Christianity as well. The initial recommendations returned straight females who all have kids.\n",
    "- In terms of the other features that weren't part of the matching criteria, the user input has a diet consisting of `anything`, `yes` to drinks, and `no` to drugs, all returning recommended profiles similar for the most part, aside from user `23127` who indicated that they don't drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liked Profiles + Additional Matches**\n",
    "- The User indicated that he liked profile `54734`, since the straight female is of a `fit` body type and likes dogs and has cats, whereas the User is also of a `fit` body type and likes dogs. Additionally, the User liked profile `50152`, to provide potential variation to the additional matches, since the straight female is of a `curvy` body type. Similarly, the straight female profile has kids and likes dogs, similar to that of the User's preferences.\n",
    "- In terms of the **additional recommended profiles**, they are based off the liked profiles the User specified, while still performing cosine similarity against a filtered dataset based on the User's age range, orientation, and religion preference. The only matching criteria that is *directly related* to liked profile is `offspring sentiment`. Since one of the liked profiles indicate that the profile `has a kid, and might want more`, the additional matches returned have users that have kids as well.\n",
    "- Additionally, since profile `54734` has a body type of `fit`, we're getting back several additional matches of useres with that of body type `athletic` or `fit."

Additionally, the User liked profile `15047`, to like an additional profile with a `fit` body type. Similarly, this straight male profile has kids and likes dogs, similar to that of the User's preferences.\n",
    "- In terms of the **additional recommended profiles**, they are based off the liked profiles the User specified, while still performing cosine similarity against a filtered dataset based on the User's age range, orientation, and religion preference. The only matching criteria that is *directly related* to liked profile is `offspring sentiment`. Since both liked profiles are of `fit` body type, the additional matches returned have users that are either `fit` or `athletic`.\n",

A user specifying their religion indicates that religion matters to them, so the recommendations return other users who are Christian / serious about Christianity as well. The initial recommendations returned a mix of gay and bisexual females who have kids.\n",

Additionally, only four matches returned, potentially due to the combination of user inputs and matching criteria that had a small pool of users to recommend. After all, there are only 1.6k Christianity profiles overall, not including filtering based on additional matching criteria. similarly, The user inputted `yes` to drugs, whereas all initial matches had users who don't take drugs. Similarly, there are just under 400 profiles overall of users who noted that they take drugs.\n",
